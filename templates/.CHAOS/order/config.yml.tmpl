# ORDER Configuration
#
# Safety limits and behavior settings for autonomous operation.

# Safety limits - hard stops that cannot be exceeded
safety:
  max_iterations: 100          # Stop after N specs processed
  max_time_hours: 24           # Stop after N hours
  max_cost_dollars: 50.00      # Stop after estimated $N spent
  max_consecutive_failures: 10 # Stop after N failures in a row

# Behavior settings
behavior:
  on_unresolvable: skip        # skip | halt
  auto_commit: true            # Commit after each successful spec
  branch_prefix: order/        # Git branch prefix for changes
  dry_run: false               # Simulate without making changes

# Autonomous spec generation (for /loop --auto)
autonomous:
  enabled: false               # Set to true to enable auto mode

  # Health thresholds (must pass before new features)
  health_gates:
    min_test_coverage: 70      # Percentage
    max_critical_issues: 0     # Security/critical bugs
    max_high_issues: 5         # High-severity tech debt

  # What ORDER can generate
  allow_feature_specs: false   # Only improvements until healthy
  improvement_categories:
    - tech_debt
    - test_coverage
    - security
    - performance
